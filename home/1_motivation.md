# 1. Motivation

Frankly, learning distributed systems (for computing) is a low priority for me, as of now.

First, learn how to do stuff, i.e. computing (e.g. gui-apps, databases etc) for small, monolithic systems.

Then, secondly, I'll learn about microservices (a super apps made of apps that talk to each other).

Finally, I'll learn about distributed systems (homogeneous nodes work together to achieve a common goal), which I view as weaving together the 
computing stuff I learn for small and self-contained systems.
